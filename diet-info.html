                  To understand nutrition it is important to understand its fundamental concept.<br>
                  <strong>Kilojoules and Calories</strong><br>
                  Have you ever tried reading the labels of a food packaging but understood what those numbers and words meant?
                  In food labels, Kilojoules and Calories often appear.

                  <li>Kilojoules (kJ) is the measurement of energy within foods and drinks.</li>
                  <li>Calories (kcal/Cal) is the energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1°C.</li>

                  Both terms are easy to use, just remember that 1 Calorie (kcal/Cal) = 4.1868 Kilojoules (kJ), or simply 4.2 kJ (RapidTables, 2014).
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  Next the macronutrients. They are essentially nutrients that provide calories or energy (Australian Food and Grocery Council, 2011; McKinley Health Center 2014).
                  There are 3 types.

                  <li><strong><a href="#protein">Proteins.</a></strong> Provide 4 Cal / 17 kJ per gram.</li>
                  <li><strong><a href="#carbs">Cabohydrates (carbs).</a></strong> Provide 4 Cal / 17 kJ per gram.</li>
                  <li><strong><a href="#fat">Fats.</a></strong> Provide 9 Cal / 37 kJ per gram.</li>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Compiled from several websites (Healthy Life Media, 2015; Helpguide.org, 2015; Mayo Clinic, 2015b), we obtain the optimal nutritional intake guideline that you should follow to achieve a healthy eating habit. For an average adult:

                  <li>Proteins: 10-30%</li>
                  <li>Carbohydrates: 40-60%</li>
                  <li>Fats: 20-30%</li>
                  <li>Sodium: 920-2300mg, approx 6 grams of salt.</li>
                  <li>Other vitamins</li>

                <p id="protein">
                  <div id="header3">Protein</div>
                  Protein is an important nutrient as it is used as a source of calories and energy.
                  This nutrient is also necessary for growth and development of our bodies, as the cells in the body include protein.
                  Protein is mostly used by your muscles to help repair the muscle tissues after a workout.
                  They are mostly found animal-based food although they are available in different food sources like legumes, etc (Group Health, 2015)
                  <br>
                  Proteins are mostly found in animal-based foods. For animal-based foods, its recommended to eat white meat, such as fish, poultry as they are leaner, having less saturated fat. For non animal-based foods, there are also plenty of source that provide protein, such as tofu, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds (WebMD, 2015b).
                  Recommendations for good source of protein: Fish, Lean Chicken, Lean Beef, Tofu, Eggs, Dairy (Milk, Cheese and Yoghurt) (Healthaliciousness, 2015).

                <p id="carbs">
                  <div id="header3">Carbohydrate</div>
                  Carbohydrates are the main energy source for our bodies, such as our brains.
                  There are 3 types of carbohydrates: simple sugars (simple carbohydrates), more complex starches (complex carbohydrates) and fiber.
                  They are found naturally in legumes, grains, starchy foods, vegetables and fruits, etc.
                  They are also added to produced foods.
                  Sugar is the simple type of carbohydrates that is digested easily by our bodies, due to their simple structure, hence simple carbohydrates.
                  Unlike complex carbohydrates that take longer to digest thus keeping us full for a longer period.
                  Sugar is actually one of our main energy sources as it produces glucose which our body requires.
                  Sugar can be naturally found in some foods but is also added to processed foods.
                  <br>
                  Fibre has two basic types, although its most known definition is that is part of plant-based foods that our body doesn't digest and absorb.
                  The two basic types of fibre: soluble and insoluble.
                  Soluble fibre are digested by our bodies and has the same calorie quantity as a carbohydrate.
                  It may help improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels.
                  Insoluble fibre are not digested by our bodies, therefore it has no calories, however it adds bulk to our stool and can help prevent constipation.
                  Vegetables, wheat bran and other whole grains are good source of insoluble fibre.
                  <br>
                  Carbohydrates are really broad as many processed food have carbohydrates.
                  To simplify which carbohydrates are good for you is to separate them by unprocessed or minimally processed foods such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans, as they contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and more.
                  On the other side we have highly processed or refined foods such as white bread, pastries, sodas which should be avoided.
                  Eat unprocessed food rather than processed food as they generally contain a lot of simple carbohydrates.
                  Eat whole grain bread instead of white bread as they contain complex carbohydrates. Eat fruits rather than drinking processed fruit juice. etc (The President and Fellows of Harvard College, 2015).

                  <div id="header3">Fat</div>
                  Fats can be separated into 2 groups.
                  Fats that can help our body absorb essential vitamins,  maintains the structure and function of cell membranes, and helps keep your immune system working.
                  Those fats are mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fat (omega-3 & omega-6) (Mayo Clinic, 2015a).
                  However there are fats that can increase your risk of heart disease and other health problems.
                  Those fats are saturated and trans fat (Health Check, 2010).
                  Despite that, fats still contain a lot of calories and it increases the risk of weight gain.
                  <br>
                  You'd think that avoiding fat is the way to go, well, you're wrong. It is important to consume healthy fats such as mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fats whilst avoiding saturated and trans fat. How do we tell them apart? Saturated fats are commonly found in animal-based products such as fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, butter, etc.
                  Trans fat are commonly found in processed foods such as snack foods, fast food and ready-prepared foods.
                  <br>
                  Eat seeds and nuts such as almonds, walnuts, etc. Avocado is a good source of fat.
                  Avoid eating processed food and fried foods, while limiting intake of animal-based foods as they are not completely bad.
                  As well as fish that contain omega fat. However do keep in mind that fat is high in calories, so make sure to limit intake in fatty foods.
